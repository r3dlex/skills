# Domain Modeling

Actively build and sharpen the project's domain model as you design. This is the *active* discipline — challenging terms, inventing edge-case scenarios, and writing the glossary and decisions down the moment they crystallise.

Merely *reading* `CONTEXT.md` for vocabulary is not this skill — that is a one-line habit any skill can do. Reach for this skill when you are changing the model, not just consuming it.

## File structure

Most repos have a single context: a `CONTEXT.md` at the root, with ADRs under `docs/adr/`.

If a `CONTEXT-MAP.md` exists at the root, the repo has multiple contexts. The map points to where each one lives — typically a `CONTEXT.md` per context directory (`src/ordering/`, `src/billing/`), with context-specific ADRs alongside and system-wide ADRs at the root.

Create files lazily — only when you have something to write. If no `CONTEXT.md` exists, create one when the first term is resolved. If no ADR directory exists, create it when the first ADR is needed.

Some repos pin a different ADR location (this one uses `docs/architecture/adr/`). Follow the target repo's convention when it has one.

## During the session

### Challenge against the glossary

When the user uses a term that conflicts with the existing language in `CONTEXT.md`, call it out immediately. "Your glossary defines 'cancellation' as X, but you seem to mean Y — which is it?"

### Sharpen fuzzy language

When the user uses vague or overloaded terms, propose a precise canonical term. "You're saying 'account' — do you mean the Customer or the User? Those are different things."

### Discuss concrete scenarios

When domain relationships are being discussed, stress-test them with specific scenarios. Invent scenarios that probe edge cases and force the user to be precise about the boundaries between concepts.

### Cross-reference with code

When the user states how something works, check whether the code agrees. If you find a contradiction, surface it: "Your code cancels entire Orders, but you just said partial cancellation is possible — which is right?"

### Update CONTEXT.md inline

When a term is resolved, update `CONTEXT.md` right there. Don't batch these up — capture them as they happen. Use the format in [CONTEXT-FORMAT.md](CONTEXT-FORMAT.md).

`CONTEXT.md` should be totally devoid of implementation details. Do not treat it as a spec, a scratch pad, or a repository for implementation decisions. It is a glossary and nothing else.

### Offer ADRs sparingly

Only offer to create an ADR when all three are true:

1. **Hard to reverse** — the cost of changing your mind later is meaningful
2. **Surprising without context** — a future reader will wonder "why did they do it this way?"
3. **The result of a real trade-off** — there were genuine alternatives and you picked one for specific reasons

If any of the three is missing, skip the ADR. Use the format in [ADR-FORMAT.md](ADR-FORMAT.md), which also lists what qualifies.
