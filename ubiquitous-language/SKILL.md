# Ubiquitous Language

Extract and formalize domain terminology from the current conversation into a consistent glossary, saved to a local file.

## Process

1. **Scan the conversation** for domain-relevant nouns, verbs, and concepts
2. **Identify problems**:
   - Same word used for different concepts (ambiguity)
   - Different words used for the same concept (synonyms)
   - Vague or overloaded terms
3. **Propose a canonical glossary** with opinionated term choices
4. **Write to `raw/UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md`** in the working directory using the format below. If content is split into sections, write each section to `raw/UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE/{section-name}.md` and document the folder structure in `raw/UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md`.
5. **Output a summary** inline in the conversation

## Output Format

Write a `raw/UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md` file with this structure:

```md
# Ubiquitous Language

## Order lifecycle

| Term        | Definition                                              | Aliases to avoid      |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Order**   | A customer's request to purchase one or more items      | Purchase, transaction |
| **Invoice** | A request for payment sent to a customer after delivery | Bill, payment request |

## People

| Term         | Definition                                  | Aliases to avoid       |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Customer** | A person or organization that places orders | Client, buyer, account |
| **User**     | An authentication identity in the system    | Login, account         |

## Relationships

- An **Invoice** belongs to exactly one **Customer**
- An **Order** produces one or more **Invoices**

## Example dialogue

> **Dev:** "When a **Customer** places an **Order**, do we create the **Invoice** immediately?"
> **Domain expert:** "No — an **Invoice** is only generated once a **Fulfillment** is confirmed. A single **Order** can produce multiple **Invoices** if items ship in separate **Shipments**."
> **Dev:** "So if a **Shipment** is cancelled before dispatch, no **Invoice** exists for it?"
> **Domain expert:** "Exactly. The **Invoice** lifecycle is tied to the **Fulfillment**, not the **Order**."

## Flagged ambiguities

- "account" was used to mean both **Customer** and **User** — these are distinct concepts: a **Customer** places orders, while a **User** is an authentication identity that may or may not represent a **Customer**.
```

## Rules

- **Be opinionated.** Pick the best term when multiple exist for the same concept. List others as aliases to avoid.
- **Flag conflicts explicitly.** Call out ambiguous usage in "Flagged ambiguities" with a recommendation.
- **Keep definitions tight.** One sentence max. Define what it IS, not what it does.
- **Only include domain terms.** Skip module/class names unless they have domain meaning.
- **Show relationships.** Use bold term names and express cardinality.
- **Group terms** into tables when natural clusters emerge (by subdomain, lifecycle, or actor). One table is fine if all terms are cohesive — don't force groupings.
- **Write example dialogue.** 3-5 exchanges between dev and domain expert demonstrating terms in action.

<example>

## Example dialogue

> **Dev:** "How do I test the **sync service** without Docker?"

> **Domain expert:** "Provide the **filesystem layer** instead of the **Docker layer**. It implements the same **Sandbox service** interface but uses a local directory as the **sandbox**."

> **Dev:** "So **sync-in** still creates a **bundle** and unpacks it?"

> **Domain expert:** "Exactly. The **sync service** doesn't know which layer it's talking to. It calls `exec` and `copyIn` — the **filesystem layer** just runs those as local shell commands."

</example>

## Re-running

When invoked again in the same conversation:

1. Read the existing `raw/UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md`
2. Incorporate any new terms from subsequent discussion
3. Update definitions if understanding has evolved
4. Re-flag any new ambiguities
5. Rewrite the example dialogue to incorporate new terms
